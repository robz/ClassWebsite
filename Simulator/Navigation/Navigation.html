	<h4>For the curious:</h4>
	<p>First, I calculate an occupancy grid (gray) from a list of polygons and circles (tan). When a destination is chosen, an A* search (the heuristic being the cost to the goal without occupied cells) goes through the grid using 8 actions (north, north-east, east, etc.) while keeping into account the size of the robot on the grid. The path is then "smoothed" using gradient descent, which results to something like tightening a rope. The line following uses a "virtual" line sensor that surrounds the robot in a small circle. The error used in line following (only PD since the I term is set to 0) is the difference between the heading of the robot and direction to where the path intersects the circular line sensor. That intersection point is shown as a red dot.<br/> View the source for details.</p>
