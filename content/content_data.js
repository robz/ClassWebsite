	text:"I'm a third year Computer Science and Computer Engineering major \
	at the University of Texas at Austin. I'm interested in everything to do \
	with computers. I enjoy hanging out with people who ask existential \
	questions. I like piano keys, rainy days, and comfortable dead ends.\
	<br/><br/>\
	Speaking of dead ends, it looks as if you've found my webspace. I whipped \
	this place up to get a quick feel for html, css, javascript, and php. Feel \
	free to browse around. Let me know if there's something I can help you with."},
