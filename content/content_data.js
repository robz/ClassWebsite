	Speaking of dead ends, it looks as if you've found my webspace! I whipped \
	this place up to get a quick feel for html, css, javascript, and php. Feel \

	text:"No one will ever manage to banish from my thoughts the notion that raw food with mayonnaise is \
somehow deeply sexual. The hard vegetable insinuating its way into the unctuousness of the cream; \
unlike many other preparations, here there is no chemistry causing each of the two foodstuffs to \
sacrifice a part of its nature and espouse that of the other, thus becoming through osmosis, like \
bread and butter, a new and wonderful substance. In this case, mayonnaise and vegetables remain \
perennial, each identical to its own self but, as in the carnal act, hopelessly ecstatic at being \
together. As for the meat, it nevertheless does obtain something more: its texture is elastic and \
porous, it yields to the bite and fills with mayonnaise in such a way that what one is chewing on, \
without false modesty, is something firm at heart that has been drizzled with a velvety moisture. \
Add to this the delicacy of a smooth flavor, for there is nothing biting about mayonnaise, no hot \
spiciness--like water, it surprises one's mouth with its affable neutrality; then come the \
exquisite nuances of the spread of vegetables: insolent tang of radishes and cauliflower, watery \
sweetness of the tomato, discreet acidity of broccoli, generosity of the carrot upon the tongue, \
the crunchy licorice hints of celery... a treat fit for a king."}
