	questions. I like piano keys, rainy days, and comfortable dead ends.\
	<br/><br/>\
	Speaking of dead ends, it looks as if you've found my webspace. I whipped \
	this place up to get a quick feel for html, css, javascript, and php. Feel \
	free to browse around. Let me know if there's something I can help you with."},

	<li><a href=\"GDocTest/synctest.html\">a google-docs-like realtime typing box</a></li>\
	<li><a href=\"VoronoiCanvas/index.html\">an html5 attempt at making dynamic voronoi graphs</a></li>\
