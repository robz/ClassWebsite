<h3>Hello.</h3>I'm a third year Computer Science and Computer Engineering major at the University of Texas at Austin. I'm interested in everything to do with computers. I enjoy hanging out with people who ask existential questions. I like piano keys, rainy days, and comfortable dead ends.

Speaking of dead ends, it looks as if you've found my webspace. I whipped this place up to get a quick feel for html, css, and javascript. Feel free to browse around. Let me know if there's something I can help you with.
